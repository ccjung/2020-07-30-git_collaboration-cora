Git collaboration notes

- `git clone <url>` : downloads the repository from the web to your local computer
    - make sure your don't nest this command into another repository
    - just like `git init` , only do this once per repo

- `git branch <branch_name>`: create a new branch where HEAD is
    - ` git branch -a `: list all branches git know of 
- `git switch <branch_name>` : move to branch
    - `git checkout <branch_name>`: the pre-August 2019 way
